A quick script to batch overlay text onto images

## Why?
Because a long time ago there was a website that hosted manatee memes and it made my wife happy. Now the website is gone, leaving a manatee sized hole in the internet meme ecosystem, and making my wife sad. There are precious few times where being a programmer is actually useful and dammit, this is one of those times.
